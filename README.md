# Don't Forget Brett

> *This will be a project for Brett Daly's surviving family. I can only image how much his mother and brother miss him. As well as all of the people that he knew before I met him. This project will slowly be wrangled together by the community of people that he touched in his final days. This project is for everyone mentioned, involved or who knew him and especially most of all, our dearly missed friend and cohort.*

## Share a Story about Brett

People who knew Brett can prepare one or more short stories about him. Something they would like to share to his family. They can ask friends to ask friends to do the same. Anyone can upload photos (story or not). 

You'll be provided several copies of a flier (for yourself and to circulate) with a description of the project, an email, phone number, public Google Drive or Dropbox folder. 

If you're into doing a story you can get in touch. When you're ready we can schedule a time to meet up with me to make an audio recording. We can do it as an interview or you can just narrate it or we can just talk about him and edit it later. However you want. It can be a loose idea or a solid immutable text.

If you want you can provide photographs of yourself (or I can take some) to pair with your story. 

> *Due to the lifestyle we all lead (or have led) it's understandable to not want to provide real names or photos of oneself, but I don't want that to stop anyone from contributing. Honestly aside from super incriminating stories, I don't think it would matter much... and really incriminating stories are maybe not the best to share to our fallen comrades' family, but hey, if that's the best you got, I want it. If even just to hear it myself :)*

## What am I going to do with all this?

**The recordings will be made into a website with their storyteller's photo(s).** So there will (hopefully) be a face to the voice and maybe some other pictures along with them.

Then I'm going to take the recordings, render them into text with photos and lay them out into an **accompanying book for his family** in case the website should go offline or the domain should expire someday far in the future (if I or no one else is available to maintain it).

**I know we can really work together and do this** 

>  *Just... please don't put it off lest you or I die too (as so frequently happens). Cause then these memorial projects are just going to stack up infinitely and nothing will get done*
